- Personal Resume Website for Danylo Dotsenko 
- Some notes:
    - Styling is completed in tandem with Ruby Compass, using SASS stylesheets. 
    - Changes will be made non-extensively moving forward, and will primarily be minor contextual changes.
- Future Implementations:
    - Use dynamic server to host application, and implement appropriate framework functionality, where required. 
    - Implement detail mode. 
    - Add Portfolio, once it is configured/exists (lol).
    - Cleanup codestyle/code formatting.
